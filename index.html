  <h2><b>The Internet</b></h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web is the largest computer network in the world. The web works as a series of four component parts.
  <br>You, your computer/browser, the Internet itself, and the servers all make up what is collectively known as the Internet.
  <br>Your browser is a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web. Servers are computers that
  <br>host these files. Your browser makes a request to these servers using HTTP, the main protocol of the web.

  <h2><b>HTML </b></h2>
  <p>HTML is an acronym for "Hypertext markup language." HTML code is the basis for almost every page on the web.
  <br>HTML consists of the text content of the page, the markup for that text, references to other documents, and links to
  <br>other pages on the web. HTML is coded using elements. HTML tags are a type of element that defines the format/display 
  <br>of the content of that page. </p>
   </div>
  <div class = "lesson-content"> 
    <h2><b> Inline and Block Elements </b></h2>
  <p>HTML elements can be either inline of block. Block elements create an invisible box around a body of text. The break
    <br> tag is an inline element, while the paragraph tag is a block element.</p></div>
  
    <div class = "lesson-content"><h2><b>Note on Coding</b></h2>
  <p>Because computers do not think like we do, tiny mistakes in code, like not forgetting a closing tag, become big mistakes
  <br>for computers. Although a mistake may seem insignificant to us, it can yield an entire section of code meaningless to a 
    <br>computer. Secondly, it is important to remember that eliminating repitition is fundamental to good coding. Reptition in your <br> HTML, CSS, or both can be detrimental to your webpage. </p></div>

  <h1> Notes for Creating a Structured Document Lesson 2</h1>
  
  <div class = "lesson-content">
     <h2><b>Thinking of a Website as a House</b></h2>
  <p> A house and a website may not seem very similar, but in reality, a house is a great analogy for a website. Think of the entire
  <br> house as the website itself. Now consider the two programming languages - CSS and HTML. If the website is the whole house
  <br> then the HTML is the structure - walls, rooms, etc. - and the CSS is the style of the home - color, decorations, etc. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, HTML is the structure of the webpage, while CSS is the formatting and style.

    <h2><b>Analyzing Pages on the Web</b></h2> 
  <p> To analyze the HTML structure of any webpage online, you can right click on the page and go to the "inspect element"option.
  <br> A new window will open on the page containing all the HTML code, as well as the stylings (CSS). If you click the triangles to the
  <br>left of the code and continue to do so for all of the triangles on the page, the DOM (Document Object Model) structure of the page
  <br>will appear. This is the tree like structure of the webpage. 
  </p>
  </div>
  <div class = "lesson-content">
    <h2><b>Looking at a Webpage in terms of Boxes</b></h2> 
  <p>Everything on a webpage is rectangular. Even circles and other shapes seen on a webpage are contained in boxes. We define
    <br> the boxes of a webpage using the "div" tag.

  <h1>Adding CSS Style to your Code Lesson 3</h1>
    <div class = "lesson-content"><h2><b>CSS Basics</b></h2>
      <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a programming language that adds style to the structure of an HTML document. <br> A link to your CSS code should be put in the header section of HTML code. CSS properties can be added to HTML using selecotrs, <br> which are keywords that apply a CSS property to all that apply on that page. The CSS selectors can be a tag or a class. If the selector is <br> a tag, refer to it without a period before it. If the selector is a class it should be referred to with a period before it. The CSS properties <br> should be referred to in the format: "attribute.value."</p> </div>
    <div class = "lesson-content"> <h2><b>What to do with CSS</b></h2> 
    <p>CSS can be used to change text color, font, border radius, the margins of your page, the font weight, the text alignment, and much more. <br> In order to manipulate these properties, you must select the correct attribute and assign it a value. </p> </div>
    <div class = "lesson-content"> <h2><b>The Box Model</b></h2>
    <p>Because every HTML document can be broken down into a series of boxes, and CSS can be used to manipulate these boxes, it is important <br> to define the parts of boxes found on the internet. All HTML boxes are composed of the content, padding, border, and margin. The content is <br> the text and imaging that appears within the box. The padding clears an area around the contnet. The border clears an area around <br> the padding, and the margin is the clear space between the boxes themselves. </p></div>
